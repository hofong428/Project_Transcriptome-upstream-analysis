# Transcriptome-upstream-analysis
Transcriptome is the set of all RNA transcripts, including coding and noncoding, in an individual or a population of cells.
The original sequence obtained by sequencing contains adapter sequence or low-quality sequence, in order to ensure the information separation.
The accuracy of the analysis requires quality control of the original data to obtain high-quality sequences (i.e.
Clean Reads), the original sequence quality control standards are:
(1) Remove reads containing adapters;
(2) Filter out low-quality data to ensure data quality;
(3) Remove reads with a ratio of more than 5% containing N (base information cannot be determined);
